    <strong><h1>Proposed System:</h1></strong><h3>
<ul>
<strong>To overcome all the problems in the existing College Management System, we have proposed a new system with the following actions.</strong><br><br>

<li>A web page has been created with separate logins and profiles with good security for students.</li><br>
<li>Student can search his/her results as soon as results are announced in their own profiles and they can check their fee dues and can pay that online from their own logins.</li><br>
<li>Student can choose the fee structure in the way they want to pay and can pay that separately by providing the details based on the method payment they choose.</li><br>
<li>Student can pay college fee, university fee, exam fee, transport fee, CRT fee, etc,.</li><br>
<li>An Administrator can check status of students who paid the fee and how much. He can insert the fee details from his login which reflects into students fee dues.</li><br>
